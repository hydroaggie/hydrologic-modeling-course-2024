# Modeling Logan River Discharge Using the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS)
This repository contains data and scripts necessary for reproducing the modeling of Logan River discharge using the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS).

## Summary
Water resources management is essential for sustaining ecosystems, agriculture, and urban development. In Logan City, Utah, the Logan River supports local communities and ecosystems, but changing precipitation patterns due to climate change and urbanization are altering its hydrological behavior. Understanding how precipitation affects river discharge is crucial for effective water planning and flood management. This project uses the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), a state-of-the-art hydrological modeling tool, to quantify the relationship between precipitation and river discharge in the Logan River basin. The overall goal is to develop a calibrated ATS model that provides insights into how future climate and land-use changes may impact the river’s flow regime, contributing to improved water management and flood risk assessment for Logan City.

## Methods
- Modeling tool
The Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) will be used for this project. ATS is a process-based hydrologic model capable of simulating coupled surface-subsurface hydrological processes, making it ideal for handling the Logan River basin’s complex terrain, heterogeneous soil properties, and variable precipitation inputs.

- Study Area
The study area is the Logan River basin in northern Utah. This basin features diverse land use, topography, and a well-documented hydrological record, which will support model calibration and validation.
